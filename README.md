# getTemperature

Challenge for position as SW-developer. The challenge consists of reading values from a thermometer connected to an ADC, converting them 
to temperature values, parsing them to JSON format, and sending them to a HTTP REST endpoint.

In this project I am being introduced to a lot of new subjects. Because of this I am focusing on functionality, and not on conventional code.
This will lead to some "inproper" coding.
